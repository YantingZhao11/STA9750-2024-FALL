    "text": "This project focuses on analyzing farebox recovery, the fraction of transit revenue generated from fares, using data from the National Transit Database (NTD). The analysis examines key metrics, including farebox revenues, operating expenses, ridership (total number of trips), and vehicle miles traveled (VMT). Given the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the data reflects some post-pandemic irregularities. For consistency, we utilize 2022 data across all categories, recognizing the lag in reporting. The goal is not to make long-term forecasts but to gain insights into the performance and financial sustainability of various transit agencies."

    "text": "Additional Transit Insights\n\nAgency with the Least Total VRM: The Barnegat Bay Decoy & Baymen’s Museum had the least total VRM in this sample, reporting only 2,312 VRM. This suggests minimal operational activity for this agency.\nMode with the Least Total VRM: The Aerial Tramway mode had the least VRM among transit modes, with a total of 292,860 VRM, highlighting its smaller operational footprint compared to other modes.\nAgency with the Least Total UPT: Enterprise Holdings, LLC had the fewest total Unlinked Passenger Trips, with only 858 trips in the dataset. This reflects the lower passenger activity of this particular agency.\n\n\nTo deepen the analysis of transit data, a new table was constructed from the USAGE dataset, focusing on the total Unlinked Passenger Trips (UPT) and Vehicle Revenue Miles (VRM) for 2022. This involved utilizing R functions like group_by, summarize, and filter, along with the year function to isolate data for 2022. The final table, named USAGE_2022_ANNUAL, included the key fields: NTD ID, Agency, Metro Area, Mode, UPT, and VRM. After summarizing the data, the table was ungrouped for further manipulation.\n\nThis new table was then merged with the FINANCIALS dataset using a left join, matched by NTD ID and Mode. The merge allowed for a comprehensive view of both operational usage and financial data, creating the USAGE_AND_FINANCIALS dataset, which was used to investigate farebox recovery and efficiency across transit systems.\n\nSeveral key questions were addressed using this enriched dataset:\n\nMost UPT in 2022: The New York City Subway (Heavy Rail) operated by the MTA had the highest UPT in 2022, with an impressive 1.79 billion trips. The system also reported 338 million VRM and collected over $2.32 billion in fares, making it the largest transit system by ridership.\nHighest Farebox Recovery Ratio: The Transit Authority of Central Kentucky in the Elizabethtown–Radcliff, KY metro area achieved the highest farebox recovery ratio. Operating in the Vanpool mode, it reported 9,640 UPT and 94,027 VRM, collecting $97,300 in total fares. With operating expenses of $40,801, the agency achieved a farebox recovery ratio of 2.38, demonstrating highly efficient cost recovery despite its smaller operational scale.\nLowest Expenses per UPT: The North Carolina State University Motorbus system, based in Raleigh, NC, had the lowest expenses per UPT among motorbus services. With 2.31 million UPT and 531,555 VRM, it operated at low costs, reporting $2,727,412 in total expenses and zero fares, likely reflecting a fare-free model or heavy subsidy reliance. The motorbus system achieved an expense per UPT ratio of $1.18, highlighting its cost-effective operation despite not generating revenue from fares.\nHighest Fares per UPT: The Altoona Metro Transit (Demand Response) in Altoona, PA, had the highest total fares per UPT, despite its very small scale. With just 26 trips, it managed to collect $17,058 in fares, indicating a significant fare collection per passenger trip.\nLowest Expenses per VRM: The New Mexico Department of Transportation’s Vanpool service in Las Cruces reported the lowest expenses per VRM, with 118,780 UPT and 1.75 million VRM, making it highly cost-efficient. It also generated $757,574 in total fares, showing a good balance between service provision and cost control.\nHighest Fares per VRM: Chicago Water Taxi (Ferryboat) was the most efficient in terms of total fares per VRM, with 16,936 UPT and 600 VRM, generating $142,473 in fares. This highlights the high fare collection relative to the distance traveled, particularly for specialized modes like ferryboats."

    "text": "Conclusion\nIn conclusion, identifying the most efficient transit system depends on how efficiency is defined. The Transit Authority in Elizabeth, NJ, stood out in terms of farebox recovery, while the New Mexico Vanpool and Raleigh Motorbus services excelled in cost efficiency per mile and per trip, respectively. Efficiency can be viewed through various lenses—fare recovery, ridership, or operational costs—each providing a different perspective on transit system performance."
