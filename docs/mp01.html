<p>This project focuses on analyzing farebox recovery, the fraction of transit revenue generated from fares, using data from the National Transit Database (NTD). The analysis examines key metrics, including farebox revenues, operating expenses, ridership (total number of trips), and vehicle miles traveled (VMT). Given the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the data reflects some post-pandemic irregularities. For consistency, we utilize 2022 data across all categories, recognizing the lag in reporting. The goal is not to make long-term forecasts but to gain insights into the performance and financial sustainability of various transit agencies.<br>
